# Welcome to CCAP 

CCAP is a simple program to communicate with your friends, co-workers or someone who cares about security. CCAP is a simple console communication program that has a server side and a client side. At the moment we are still working on the release of version 0.1.0, which will add all the initial files. It is a program written by a single person and is not recommended at this stage for everyday use, rather for use as a starter. We have big plans for this project and will soon launch our website, but for now we are focusing on the code. The entire program is written in C.
